      <div class="question">
        <h3>Can your web development agency build a website that predicts the future?</h3>
        <div class="plus">+</div>
        <div class="minus hidden">-</div>
      </div>
      <p class="paragraph hidden">While our team is exceptionally skilled, predicting the future is not within our web
        development expertise. We
        specialize in creating responsive, visually appealing websites, not crystal balls. Sorry to disappoint any
        aspiring fortune-tellers out there!</p>

      <div class="question">
        <h3>Will my website load faster if I sprinkle it with digital fairy dust?</h3>
        <div class="plus">+</div>
        <div class="minus hidden">-</div>
      </div>
      <p class="paragraph hidden">As enchanting as that sounds, digital fairy dust is not recognized by web browsers as
        a performance-enhancing
        substance. Our secret to speedy websites lies in clean code, optimized images, and server magic, not mystical
        powders.</p>

      <div class="question">
        <h3>Can you make my website compatible with ancient browsers like the ones used by dinosaurs?</h3>
        <div class="plus">+</div>
        <div class="minus hidden">-</div>
      </div>
      <p class="paragraph hidden">While we admire the nostalgia for ancient technology, we recommend encouraging your
        dinosaur friends to upgrade
        their browsers. Our expertise lies in creating websites that thrive in the present digital age, not the
        prehistoric one.</p>

      <div class="question">
        <h3>Does your agency provide 24/7 emotional support for my website?</h3>
        <div class="plus">+</div>
        <div class="minus hidden">-</div>
      </div>
      <p class="paragraph hidden">Absolutely! Our team empathizes with your website's feelings and is available around
        the clock to offer virtual
        hugs and digital encouragement. Just kidding! We provide excellent technical support during business hours to
        keep
        your website in top shape.</p>
